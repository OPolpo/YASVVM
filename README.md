Yet Another Street View Video Maker is the final project for Digital Image Processing class.
The web-based user interface allows users to select two points on a map and calculates the route with Googleâ€™s APIs.
Information on images are collected and sent to a server, which download the photos and compose the video.
User interface allows to control work progress and to download the final video.

In order to do some experiment with frame interpolation we use [Butterflow](https://github.com/dthpham/butterflow).
